# Embedded System Control with STM32 - Activate LED

## Overview
This project is part of a course on Embedded C, focusing on direct manipulation of hardware registers on STM32 microcontroller to control GPIO peripherals.

## Key Features
- **Clock Activation**
- **Sets GPIOD pins to output mode for LED activation**

## Project Structure
- `main.c`: Contains the main logic for GPIO configuration and control.

## Hardware and Tools
- **Microcontroller**: STM32F407
- **IDE**: STM32CubeIDE

## Setup and Run
1. Load the project in STM32CubeIDE.
2. Ensure the STM32 development board is connected.
3. Compile and flash the program to the microcontroller.
